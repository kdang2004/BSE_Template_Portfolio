# Third Eye for the Blind
I am working on an Arduino Third Eye for the Blind. Users with visual disabilities are able to detect objects with the use of physical and audio cues from their very own hand.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Third Milestone
My third milestone was finishing the project and making the whole device handheld. Taking my prototype from the breadboard, I sautered the connections to my perfboard and Arduino Micro using wires and soldering tracks. This took a lot of time and patience, as I had to make sure all of my connections were secure, and that they were in the right place. After ensuring all of my connections were correct and secure, I hooked up the power source which is a 9V battery. The next step was making this portable, and I used an old glove instead of a piece of cloth to glue down my board, sensor, and power source.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was getting my button and vibrating motor to work alongside the ultrasonic sensor and button. I used the same conditional statements for the code of the vibrating motor and buzzer, which will change the frequency of alerts given off from either one. When a button is not held down, the pins are only connected in pairs. When the button is pressed, the pins are connected and the pins are internally connected. Using different conditional statements, I programmed the code to switch to buzzer mode when the button was pressed, and then default to vibrating mode when not pressed. This was in replacement of the switch used in previous projects, the only set back of this, however, was that the user would have to hold the button down for the duration of the desired mode.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was setting up my ultrasonic sensors and piezo buzzer. The ultrasonic sensor works by sending out an ultrasonic wave, and measuring the time it takes for that wave to bounce off an object and be received again by the sensor. I first tested the  sensor using basic example code in the Arduino library, to make sure that the distance measured between the sensor and target object was accurate. After getting my sensor to work, I added the piezo buzzer to the breadboard and used conditional statements to make the buzzer make noise when an onject was a certain distance. When the object is far away, there is no noise, but as the sensor gets closer to the object, the noise becomes mre high pitched and frequent, audibly letting the user know they are close to something.
