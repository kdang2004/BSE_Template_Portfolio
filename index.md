# Third Eye for the Blind
I am working on an Arduino Third Eye for the Blind. Users with visual disabilities are able to detect objects with the use of physical and audio cues from their very own hand.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Arduino, Ultrasonic Sensors, and Piezo Buzzer. I first tested the use of the ultrasonic sensor using basic startup code in the Arduino application, making sure that the distance between the sensor and target object was accurate. After getting my ultrasonic sensor to work, I hooked up the piezo buzzer to the breadboard and then used conditional statements to make the buzzer make noise when an object was a certain distance. When the object is far away, there is no noise, but as the object and sensor get closer and closer, the noise becomes more high pitched and frequent, audibly letting the user know they are close to something.
